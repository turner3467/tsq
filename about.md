TSQ exists for a simple reason.

To highlight the inequalities, injustices, and the misuses of power that are always present in society. Some of our main areas of concern are the influence of corporate funding, aspects of increasing inequality, and injustices where corporate and social interests collide. Although we wont limit ourselves to just these.

We are going to do this through thoughtful, well-researched, and corroborated articles and analyses that are backed by data cited from the most reputable sources. As we exist completely outside of the mainstream media we are independent and free from the time and editorial pressures that come with that.
