**What is TSQ all about?**

The answer is simple. To bring attention to issues of the status quo.

The TSQ exists as a publication that is outside of the mainstream media and therefore is free of the time and editorial pressures that come with that. This should translate into well-researched, thoughtful articles that offer an independent view point on the status quo.

Our main areas of interest are rising inequality, injustices, and the misuse of power, although we won't be limiting ourselves to just these three. We want to highlight current issues, reveal the main causes, and, hopefully, offer an opinion on how to combat them. To do this we'll be relying heavily on data and statistics to illuminate these issues, but don't worry, all of the analysis will be clear, reproducible, and most importantly cited. The sources of all data and the code will be available should you want to dig into it yourself.

As we are based in the UK there will, almost unavoidably, be a bias towards UK topics. This is purely because this is the area we are most familiar with and most qualified to write about. Having said that, should we come across issues elsewhere that we feel need highlighting we won't hesitate to cover them.

We will be trying publish an article once per week, but as we are tied down at full time jobs and we want to cover our topics in detail it might not be possible to keep this rate up consistently. Anyway we've rambled on quite enough for our first piece, all that remains to be said is that we hope you enjoy our upcoming articles and that you find them thought provoking.

Welcome and thank you for reading!
